# Stroke-Prediction

The primary goal of this project is to develop a prediction model that can accurately determine whether a patient is likely to suffer a stroke based on various input parameters. Data exploration and model building will answer the following questions: 
1.	How does the incidence of stroke vary based on the patient's smoking status? Are former smokers at a higher risk of stroke than current smokers or non-smokers?
2.	Is there any difference in stroke incidence between rural and urban areas?
3.	What is the distribution of patients with hypotension or heart disease? Is the incidence of stroke higher in patients with these conditions?
